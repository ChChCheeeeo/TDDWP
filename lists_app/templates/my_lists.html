<!--
     several design decisions in this template which are going to filter their way down through the code

     want a variable called owner to represent the user in our template
     want to be able to iterate through the lists created by the user using owner.list_set.all (free frome the Django ORM)
     want to use list.name to print out the "name" of the list, which is currently specified as the text of its first element
-->
{% block extra_content %}
    <h2>{{ owner.email }}'s lists</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for list in owner.list_set.all %}
            <li><a href="{{ list.get_absolute_url }}">{{ list.name }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
